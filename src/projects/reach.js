    <h1>Reach: Discover Events</h1>
    <p>Reach is an iOS platform I developed that allows users to find and create events 
        in their area. Through the interactive map feature, users can filter events by 
        area, event type, privacy level, and time. Events are user generated through an 
        easy to use and quick UI, to which joined users can add images, comments, and invite 
        their friends.
